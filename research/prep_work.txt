-   Currently, IoT consists of many vertical systems
-   The goal is to be able to connect devices on a horizontal level
        e.g. A sprinkler should be able to detect motion on the grass.
-   IFTTT.com and zAPIer.com provide services to create own conditionals
    between devices and systems. These services do not lead to
    rapid IoT deployment
-   Internet has to become more flat, P2P to enable the full benefits
    of IoT
-   Security will play a very important role in the development of IoT
